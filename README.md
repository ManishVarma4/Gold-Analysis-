Gold Price Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing gold price trends over time using advanced data analysis techniques. The aim is to uncover key patterns, understand factors influencing gold prices, and develop models for future price predictions.

Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed  here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/novandraanugrah/xauusd-gold-price-historical-data-2004-2024?select=XAU_1w_data_2004_to_2024-09-20.csv.

Features of the Dataset
The dataset provides the following key attributes:

Historical gold prices

Date and time of each data point

Macroeconomic indicators (e.g., inflation, currency exchange rates)

Market-related metrics (e.g., stock market indices)

Analysis Performed
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and relationships in historical gold price data.

Time Series Analysis: Identifying patterns such as seasonality and trends over time.

Correlation Analysis: Exploring relationships between gold prices and external factors (e.g., inflation rates, currency fluctuations).

Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python.

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,etc.

IDE: Jupyter Notebook for code development and documentation.

Results
The analysis highlights significant trends in gold prices, including seasonal variations and the influence of economic factors. Predictive models were tested and refined for reliable gold price forecasting.
